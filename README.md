# Myco-Log

**A front end application built by Kim Ward.**

Myco-Log is the final solo project built during Mod 3 of Turing School of Software & Design.

<!-- This project focused on using Test Driven Development and Object Oriented Programming to build an interactive travel site where users can log in to view their trips and book a new trip. The Fetch API was used to retrieve and post data. Specifications for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html). -->

## Goals

- Use React's component-based architecture to design and build an application
- Use React Router to simulate a multi-page experience
- Use Asynchronous JavaScript to send and retrieve data from an API
- Write end-to-end tests with Cypress

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo down to your machine
3. Open the root directory and run `npm i` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to initialize the webpage
5. Open the site by copying and pasting the server location http://localhost:3000/ in your address bar

## Features

**Login:**
<!-- On load, the user user sees a login form. To log in, enter `traveler` followed by a number between 1 and 50 in the username field. The password for all users is `travel`. -->

**User Dashboard:**
<!-- Once logged in, a user can see all of their trips displayed and sorted by date according to trip type (upcoming, pending, or past). The header also includes the stats on how much they've spent on trips this year. -->

### Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- React
- React Router
- Express
- SCSS
- HTML
- Cypress
- VS Code

#### Future Additions & Improvements
- Add an edit link to the user's Dashboard so they can update their Geographic region. (Will need to create a new PUT endpoint.)
- Add a redirect after a sighting is successfully recorded.

#### Design Inspiration
The light and neutral earth-toned palette was inspired by Dribble creator Matthew Gledhill's [Interior Design Website](https://dribbble.com/shots/9523892-Interior-Design-Website-Concept). The style of the listings on the Explore page were borrowed from Daniel Wiklund's [Mushroom app](https://dribbble.com/shots/1285755-Mushroom-app) on Dribbble.
